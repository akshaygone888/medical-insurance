# HealthPay Backend Developer Assignment

This project implements a simplified AI-driven medical claim processor API using FastAPI and OpenRouter (LLM API gateway). It receives medical claim PDF documents (bill, discharge summary, etc.), classifies them using a language model, extracts structured data using document-specific agents, validates the claim, and returns an approval or rejection decision.
